# CONTRIBUTING to BrainRotLang

> So, you want to contribute to BrainRotLang? Bless your soul.

First off: **Why?**

Maybe you're a glutton for punishment. Maybe you lost a bet. Maybe you just want to watch the world burn, one line of stupid code at a time. Whatever your reason, welcome aboard.

## Guidelines (or ‚ÄúHow Not to Embarrass Yourself‚Äù)

### 1. Understand What You're Getting Into
This is **BrainRotLang**. It's not meant to be that useful.

### 2. Code Style
- **Rusty but Crusty:** Follow Rust conventions, but don't stress over perfect code. This is BrainRotLang, not Rust 2.0.
- **Readable-ish:** Write code that at least *you* can understand after a coffee-fueled, sleep-deprived night.
- **No Overengineering:** If your PR has more design patterns than brain cells, reconsider your life choices.

### 3. Commit Messages
- Be descriptive.
- Puns and sarcasm encouraged.
- Example: `feat(parser): added ability to parse questionable life choices`

### 4. Submitting a PR
- Fork it.
- Branch it.
- PR it.
- Pray.

We'll review your PR with the same level of seriousness we gave to making this language (i.e., probably while laughing).

### 5. Issues & Bugs
Found a bug? Congrats, you‚Äôre now a maintainer.
- Open an issue.
- Describe the problem in excruciating detail.
- Suggest a fix, or better yet, submit a PR.

### 6. Adding Features
- New syntax? Go for it.
- More brainrot? Absolutely.
- Completely useless feature? YES.

Just make sure it compiles and runs in some universe.

## Code of Conduct
Don't be a jerk. Be excellent to each other. This is a playground for bad ideas, not bad behavior.

Thank you for your brave and ill-advised decision to contribute to brainrotlang. May your code be cursed but functional.

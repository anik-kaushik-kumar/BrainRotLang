## Why Does BrainRotLang Exist?

In a sea of programming languages, where every new language promises to "fix" what its predecessors did wrong, BrainRotLang proudly offers **nothing** of the sort.

### The Vision
- Tired of readable syntax? ✔️
- Bored of useful languages? ✔️
- Craving existential despair in code form? ✔️

BrainRotLang is your cure for too much productivity and not enough chaos. It's a love letter to bad ideas, written in the tears of programmers.

## Why Should You Care?

Because:
- ✨ It technically "works".
- 🧠 It adds to your collection of obscure knowledge you'll never use.
- 💼 Resume padding for that ironic "languages known" section.
- 🏆 Guaranteed to confuse interviewers.

## Usage

```bash
cargo build --release
```
Then, in the folder of the compiled .exe,
```
brl --help
```

OR -- just use the installer to instantly add it to PATH??
Check releases for latest installer.
